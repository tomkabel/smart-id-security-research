> This repository documents vulnerabilities that were reported to SK ID Solutions before publication. See the [responsible disclosure timeline](docs/05-enforcement/responsible-disclosure-timeline.md). The material is for education and defensive research; it is not legal advice.

## What this covers

The research uses Smart-ID as a case study for a broader question: how well do cross-device authentication flows bind the browser session to the phone that approves it?

- Cryptographic origin binding in cross-device flows
- QR-based authentication and QRLJacking attack vectors
- Man-in-the-middle exposure in out-of-band authentication
- FIDO2/WebAuthn as a standards-based comparison point
- eIDAS and GDPR obligations for trust service providers
- Migration paths from proprietary to standards-based authentication

## Key findings

The research examines how cross-device flows handle three bindings:

1. **Origin binding** – tying the credential to the relying party's origin
2. **Channel binding** – tying the authentication to the underlying TLS session
3. **User intent** – verifying presence and intent beyond a passive confirmation

Against established standards:

- **FIDO2/WebAuthn** provides origin binding at the protocol level [[1]](#references)
- **NIST SP 800-63-4** defines phishing-resistance requirements for AAL3 [[2]](#references)
- **eIDAS Article 24** requires trust service providers to use trustworthy systems [[3]](#references)

## Recommendations

**Service providers** should implement cryptographic origin binding for high-assurance authentication, evaluate FIDO2/WebAuthn as a standards-based alternative and run regular assessments aligned with NIST guidance.

**Policymakers** should clarify liability for authorised push payment fraud, set minimum security requirements beyond visual verification and align national rules with EU eIDAS implementation guidance.

## Methodology

Comparative standards analysis, architecture review against established frameworks, and offensive testing in controlled environments.

## Run the site locally

Requires Node.js 22 or newer (CI uses the version in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)).

```bash
npm ci
npm run docs:dev       # http://localhost:5173/smart-id-security-research/
npm run docs:build     # output in docs/.vitepress/dist
npm run docs:preview
```

Every pull request runs the production build, including VitePress's dead-link check. Pushes to `master` deploy to GitHub Pages.
